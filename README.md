# Currency_converter

A currency converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can use HTML to create a user interface (GUI) for entering amounts and currencies, CSS to determine the style and layout, and JavaScript to make the content interactive and implement currency conversion:
HTML: Defines the structure of the content and can be used to implement the GUI for user entries. For example, the HTML code can include fields for entering the amount and two currencies, and buttons for selecting the currencies and converting them.
CSS: Determines the style and layout of the website.
JavaScript: Can be used to implement currency conversion using functions and custom methods, such as addEventListener(), and to access a currency exchange API in the script file.
